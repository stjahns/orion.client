Running the Eclipse Web Demo</H2>
<p>This document provides an overview of the current functionality in the
Eclipse Web Demo, how to get started, and what you can expect to work.
</p>
<h3>Client Side How-To</h3>
<p>
Point your browser to <b>(we really need a demo URL)</b>.  To run
the server side yourself, see <a href="#server">Running the Server</a>.
(If we have a demo server with sample workspaces, we can have a more 
scripted demo, with some development scenario.  Until then, this is kind
of generic....)
</p>
<h4>Browsing a Workspace</h4>
<p>The tree on the left shows the projects in your workspace.  You can navigate
the workspace using the tree.  If you click on a file, the code will be displayed
in the editor on the right.  You can also create new projects, folders, or files
using the <b>New</b> dropdown on the toolbar.
</p>
<h4>Editing and Saving Code</h4>
<p>The code editor supports syntax highlighting for Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
Clicking in the editor will show you the line number/column in the status area.
To save a file, click on the save icon in the toolbar.
</p>
<h4>Checking out Code from CVS</h4>
<h4>Changing Workspaces</h4>
<p>You can change between workspaces, provided they are located as sibling folders
to the default workspace used. Click on the <b>Workspace</b> button on the toolbar
and enter the folder name of the workspace that you want to switch to.  (Note: when
we have a demo server set up, we can change these instructions to discuss what 
workspaces are available so that a script could be followed.)
</p>
<h3><a name="server">Running the Server</a></h3>
<h4>CVS Access</h4>
<p>The code is currently hosted in the Ottawa CVS server.  If you don't
have access to this server, you'll need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://iam2.torolab.ibm.com/AM/">the Toronto access server</a>.</li>
<li>Click on "My Userids".  Hopefully you will see an account listed for you called
"Ottawa LDAP 2670 Queensview" .  If not, you'll need to follow the instructions
to set up an account.</li>
<li>If you have an account but don't remember your password, you can click the
link to reset your password.  It should take 1/2 hour or so to get an email back
with a temporary password and instructions for resetting it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have a password, point your CVS connection to:
<pre>
ottcvs1.ottawa.ibm.com
/home/cvs/desktop
</pre>
</p>
<h4>Loading and Running the Server Side</h4>
<ol>
<li>Check out the <b>org.eclipse.orion.releng</b> project from HEAD.</li>
<li>Import the <b>webide.psf</b> project set file.</li>
<li>Click on the project <b>org.eclipse.orion.client.core</b> and choose 
<b>PDE Tools - Update Classpath</b> from the popup menu.  (This seems to be
necessary in some installations, not sure why).</li>
<li>open the launch configuration dialog for the <b>web-ide.launch</b> file.
In the <b>Arguments</b> tab, add a workspace location to your arguments.  For example:
<pre>
-data c:\workspaces\demo
</pre>
If you want to switch between workspaces, you should set up a directory structure
whereby the different workspaces are siblings underneath the same folder.  Something
like:
<pre>
c:\workspaces\
    demo1
    demo2
    demo3
</pre>
</li>
<li>Launch the web ide.</li>
<li>Point your browser at <a href="http://localhost:8080/simpleide.html">http://localhost:8080/simpleide.html</a></li>
</ol>
